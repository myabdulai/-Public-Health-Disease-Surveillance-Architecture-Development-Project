# Project Title

Public Health Disease Surveillance Architecture Development Project
## Overview
Public Health Disease Surveillance Architecture focuses on creating systems for health authorities to effectively track and respond to disease outbreaks. It outlines the purpose, key components, security considerations, stakeholders involved, various architecture types, and real-world examples of implementation. The primary aim is to gather and analyze health data to achieve:
- Identifying health threats promptly
- Keeping track of health patterns over time
- Informing strategies for health interventions
- Assessing the effectiveness of measures like vaccinations

## Project objective
- To successfully develop virtual machine environment by creating virtual machine for selected hospitals and connect them to each other. Install and configur OpenEMR6.0.1 in each of the hospitals' virtual machine, and demonstrate security measures for an OpenEMR instance, including database and web server configuration.
- Install and configure the Hapi-FHIR server successfully, and demonstrate troubleshooting techniques for server-related issues.
- Understand key concepts and implementation processes involving Hapi-FHIR, and demonstrate the role of Hapi-FHIR in exchanging HL7 FHIR messages from EHRs for critical
public health surveillance. Gain proficiency in utilizing Hapi-FHIR for parsing out specific information from HL7 FHIR
messages, particularly related to the disease outbreak of COVID-19.
- Develop the ability to analyze and interpret data received through Hapi-FHIR, which can be
used to identify pubic health priorities such as disease trends, monitor outbreaks, and make
informed decisions regarding resource allocation and public health interventions.
- Create a Python script to aggregate FHIR data from hospital .json files for efficient data extraction and combination. And use the aggregated data to create a visually informative dashboard in Google Looker Studio, featuring visualizations such as plot maps and bar charts to present COVID-19 case data.
